# Advent of code 2023 🦀
This repo contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenge. This year, I am planning to use Rust for all solutions. The catch is that I have never used Rust before so the goal is just for me to learn Rust. The solutions will be uploaded here as I solve them. I will then document my notes as I refer to how other people solved the same problem in Rust. Acknowledgements go to [Chris Biscardi](https://www.youtube.com/@chrisbiscardi) whose content I will be learning from.
